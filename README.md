# pandas-challenge

Code created with help from:
XLA AGI bot, who was mostly no help but did help some.
Websites: statology.org (help with groupby)

This codee should answer all challenges. "Witness Marks"  have been left in to match the starter code.
I will note nowhere in the challenge requirements does it mention deleting them like last time.
